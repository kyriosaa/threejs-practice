Practice on the different types of common materials in threejs.
Some materials such as MeshBasicMaterial and MeshNormalMaterial are not affected by light while others such as MeshPhongMaterial and MeshStandardMaterial are. MeshStandardMaterial is the most commonly used one and is the most computationally expensive material to use. MeshPhongMaterial and MeshStandardMaterial are very similar but MeshStandardMaterial is able to be used with environment maps.
